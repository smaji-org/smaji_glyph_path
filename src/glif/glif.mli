type contour_point_type =
  | Move (**  	A point of this type must be the first in a contour. The reverse is not true: a contour does not necessarily start with a move point. When a contour does start with a move point, it signifies the beginning of an open contour. *)
  | Line (** Draw a straight line from the previous point to this point. The previous point must be a move, a line, a curve or a qcurve. It must not be an offcurve. *)
  | Offcurve (** This point is part of a curve segment that goes up to the next point that is either a curve or a qcurve. *)
  | Curve (** Draw a cubic bezier curve from the last non-offcurve point to this point. The number of offcurve points can be zero, one or two. If the number of offcurve points is zero, a straight line is drawn. If it is one, a quadratic curve is drawn. If it is two, a regular cubic bezier is drawn. *)
  | Qcurve (** Draw a cubic bezier curve from the last non-offcurve point to this point. The number of offcurve points preceding this point can be zero, in which case a straight line is drawn from the last non-offcurve point to this point. *)
